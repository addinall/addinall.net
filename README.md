###Mark Addinall - 2015

##Synopsis

Another semi-experimental offering.  This started out as a Meteor/AngularJS project but was switched to an architecture 
that consisted of HTML5/CSS3-SCSS/jQuery-MOBILE/WebGL and PHP 5.x back end code for the AJaX (well actually AJaJ) RESTful
transactions.  We keep AngularJS for the bi-directional binding, but lose Meteor.

This being a one-page micro-app it will use REST for all transactions.  

My aim was to get an understanding of available development tools on offer and how they could:
- operate with each other
- integrate with emerging technologies, in this case webGL

Mixing these technologies MAY take a bit of fnangaling it seems.
