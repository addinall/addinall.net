###Plan
This one is different.  It is going to use a mix of brand new technology, a mix I think is ideal for modern web development now and in the future.  The mix being:

* AngularJS
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Meteor
* WebGL

And for the back end my long suffering HTML(5) Toolkit, this time invoking my new Mongo elements that were added last year.

More to come.  After After.
