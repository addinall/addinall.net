###Mark Addinall - 2015

##Synopsis

Another semi-experimental offering.  This started out as a Meteor/AngularJS project but was switched to an architecture 
that consisted of HTML5/CSS3-SCSS/jQuery-MOBILE/WebGL and PHP 5.x back end code for the AJaX (well actually AJaJ) RESTful
transactions.

This being a one-page micro-app it will use REST for all transactions.  

I added the WebGL because:
* I want to learn it
* This page should be a little OUT-THERE!

Later.
